    #sh -c <-> This starts a new shell session and executes the command string inside double quotes ("...")
    #xvfb-run <-> This is a wrapper for X Virtual Framebuffer (Xvfb), which creates a virtual display server
    #-a <-> This flag tells xvfb-run to automatically select an available display number. By default, xvfb uses DISPLAY=:99. If this display number is already in use, the command will fail. With -a, it avoids conflicts by dynamically picking the next available display.
    #-s '-screen 0 1920x1080x24' <-> Configures the virtual screen settings for xvfb. The -s flag lets you pass arguments directly to the underlying Xvfb server.
    ## 0: The screen number (screen 0 is the default in most X11 setups).
    ## 1920x1080: The resolution of the virtual display. This is important because some GUI applications (like browsers) might fail if the display size is too small.
    ## 24: The color depth, meaning each pixel can have 24-bit color (8 bits per channel for red, green, and blue).
